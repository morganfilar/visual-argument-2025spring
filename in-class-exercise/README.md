Reflection (for as I go)
I am working with Photoshop. 
To start, I put a road that seems to go on forever. 
I put "DANGERS" in bed red lettering and some of the letters look like they are cracking.
This puts an emphasis on what happens when you are a distracted driver (crash)
Next, I made my vision with the cracked phone come to life. 
It says "Your text can wait" on a shattered screen. 
Next, I added two cars colliding in the background. 
I used layering to be able to bring focus to the words. My font choice attracts the viewers attention and remphasises the crash 
I still want to add some more detail to make it look realistic and sad
