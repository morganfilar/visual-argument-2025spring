Reflection (for as I go)
I am working with Photoshop. 
To start, I put a road that seems to go on forever. 
I put "DANGERS" in bed red lettering and some of the letters look like they are cracking.
This puts an emphasis on what happens when you are a distracted driver (crash)
Next, I made my vision with the cracked phone come to life. 
It says "Your text can wait" on a shattered screen. 
Next, I added two cars colliding in the background. 
I used layering to be able to bring focus to the words. My font choice attracts the viewers attention and remphasises the crash 
I still want to add some more detail to make it look realistic and sad 


My projects name is going to be "Dangers of Distractions" 
I chose this because it kind of hints to the reader what my project is about/ the message I am trying to relay. 
I have been adding more little details. 
From the peer review, I got good suggestions from my classmates. I am going to change the text at the bottom to say "Save a Life" instead of "protect". 
I am going to try to add lights that resemble a cop car or an ambulance. Someone suggested this to me, but I am not sure if I will be able to complete it. My goal is so blend it out so it looks realistic. 
Lastly, someone suggested to make the second car different from the other. The image I found online was just mirrored. I played around with changing it, but I like the way it looks now.
